 **Hi, I'm Gilbert**, PhD candidate at EPFL in Switzerland. I'm broadly interested in theoretical computer science, especially in **complexity** and **algorithms** and lucky to be advised by Prof. [Mika Göös](https://theory.epfl.ch/mika/). During the summer of 2023, I was an intern at Oracle Labs in Zürich where I worked on vector databases.
