 **Hi, I'm Gilbert**, PhD candidate at EPFL in Switzerland. I'm broadly interested in theoretical computer science, especially in **complexity** and **algorithms** and lucky to be advised by Prof. [Mika Göös](https://theory.epfl.ch/mika/). During Summer 2023, I will be interning at Oracle Labs in Zürich.
