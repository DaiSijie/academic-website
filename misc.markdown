Most of my code is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DaiSijie)

### Scientific libraries

* A MapReduce **[implementation](https://github.com/DaiSijie/massive-graph-analysis)** of our [server flow coreset](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611976496.17) to get large matchings in massive graphs. The goal is to test the algorithm on real-world data and see what approximation ratio is achieved. The program runs with Hadoop (e.g. on AWS).

* **[NRGC](https://github.com/DaiSijie/non-repetetive-graph-coloring)**, a collection of scripts to compute the exact value of the [Thue number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue_number#:~:text=In%20the%20mathematical%20area%20of,the%205%2Dcycle%20is%20four.) of any graph. Built on top of Gurobi.

### Apps

* **[Voronoi drawer](https://github.com/DaiSijie/VoroDraw)**, an Android app that generates Voronoi diagrams on the fly.

* **[Nonogramer](https://github.com/DaiSijie/Nonogramer)**, a simple platform to upload and play Nonogram grids.

* **[CumulativeSelection](https://github.com/DaiSijie/genetic-algorithm)**, an app to visualise the execution of genetic algorithms.

* **[EasyGraph](https://github.com/DaiSijie/EasyGraph)**, a program to manage graphs and test algorithms.

### Hackatons

* **[Augmented reading](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/augmented-reading-experience-takes-top-prize-at--2/)**, an app that reads your book with you and decide how to set the lights and play sounds to enhence your reading experience. Winner of EPFL's [LauzHack 2019](https://devpost.com/software/augmented-reading).
